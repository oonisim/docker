    "> This is related with how process groups work, how bash behaves when invoked as a non-interactive shell with ```-c```, and **the effect of ```&``` in input commands**. The answer assumes you're familiar with **how job control works in UNIX**. If the concept of process groups and job control is completely new to you, I think you'll need to read up on that to fully understand this answer. A great resource to learn this is Chapter 9 of Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (3rd edition).\n",
